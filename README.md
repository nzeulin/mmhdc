# MM-HDC: Maximum-Margin Hyperdimensional Computing

This repository provides an implementation of the multi-class maximum-margin hyperdimensional computing (MM-HDC) classifier that adopts the optimization problem formulation of multi-class Weston-Watkins SVM to HDC.

The algorithm is implemented in the `MultiMMHDC` class, which can be imported as:

```python
from mmhdc import MultiMMHDC
from mmhdc.utils import HDTransform
```

You can install the package in editable mode and run the MNIST example as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nzeulin/mm-hdc.git
cd mm-hdc
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .
python -m pip install -r example/requirements.txt
python example/example.py --config configs/examples/mnist.py
```

C++ backend is highly recommended to use, as it can significantly accelerate the model training. In this case, use `python -m pip install -e .[cpp]`.

### Current features
- C++ backend (`libtorch`) to enable fast MM-HDC training.
- Support of floating-point prototypes and hypervectors.

Python-based backend (`_py_step` in `src/mmhdc/model.py`) should be used as a reference, ground-truth implementation only.
